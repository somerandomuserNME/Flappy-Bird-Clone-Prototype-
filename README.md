# Flappy-Bird-Clone-Prototype-
This is a Flappy Bird Clone that I have made in C++ using the SDL2 development library. I made this project in my first year of university as an attempt to learn C++ and Game Development in C++. 

Files like the RenderWindow files and Entity files is not completely my own as these files are from my attempts at learning how to use the SDL2 library from
CodeGopher's tutorial video on how to create a 2D physics based platformer using SDL2:

Gameplay loop and other logistical elements of the game were inspired from PolyMars' video on making a DS Game in 2020:

All textures were made by me using paint

This was my first attempt at creating a somewhat professional game using an entirely new language and development library, with my only prior experience with C++ was learning different
elements of object-oriented programming in my course that was taught using C and my computer science class in my senior year of highschool using Java (which is relatively similar to C++ in my opinion)
